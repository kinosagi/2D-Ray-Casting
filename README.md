# 2D-Ray-Tracing
## Overview
The purpose of this app is to simulate position sensors by using a 2D ray casting method.  
In addition to detect walls around the small white circle, the colors of casted rays indicate proximity to such walls ('red' for far and 'green' for close distances).  
The package used to develop this app was Kivy and KivyMD.
